First we need to copy "BatAO" to /usr/bin/
and them give the permission to execute: +x
	sudo cp PlayMyGamesOnLinux/Batman\ Arkham\ Origins/BatAO /usr/bin/BatAO
	sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/BatAO

After that, we need to copy "BatAO.desktop" to /usr/shar/applications
	sudo cp PlayMyGamesOnLinux/Batman\ Arkham\ Origins\BatAO.destop /usr/share/applications/BatAO.desktop
