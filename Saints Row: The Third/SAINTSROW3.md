First we need to copy "SAINTSROW3" to /usr/bin/
and them give the permission to execute: +x
	sudo cp PlayMyGamesOnLinux/Saints\ Row:\ The\ Third/SAINTSROW3 /usr/bin/SAINTSROW3
	sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/SAINTSROW3

After that, we need to copy "SAINTSROW3.desktop" to /usr/shar/applications
	sudo cp PlayMyGamesOnLinux/Saints\ Row:\ The\ Third/SAINTSROW3.desktop /usr/share/applications/SAINTSROW3.desktop
